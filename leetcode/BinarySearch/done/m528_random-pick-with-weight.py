https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/

Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
'''

class Solution(object):

    def __init__(self, w):
        """
        :type w: List[int]
        """
        

    def pickIndex(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        
'''
generate accumulative proportion array, then ramdon.randint(0, sum), binary search the acc array and return the index

'''

# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
